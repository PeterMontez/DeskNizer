# DeskNizer
After a few months of downloading random documentation, my work desktop is a mess. A bunch of random folders with a lot of random PDF files.

This code basically looks for everything in there, and neatly organizes every PDF file by their prefix.
And yes, it might have been faster to organize it all by hand, but well...
